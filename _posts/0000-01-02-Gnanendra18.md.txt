---------------------------------
git 

git is distributed version control system
github built on top of git

git configurations need to setup initially 
system level -- allusers
global -- user level
local -- project level

git config --global user.name "gnanendra18"
git config --global user.email "tognanendrakumar@gmail.com"

to check what it set use without value

----------------
git flow

git clone https://abcd.git

navigate to repository using cd dirname

git branch branchname //create a branch with given name

git branch --all // lists all the branches in the repository

git push --set-upstream origin branchName //push the branch into the repository

Committing a file
git checkout my-slide //switching to given branch name
git status // you will know which branch you are working on
after checking out add the content in your files and then stage them
git add _posts/soandsofile.xyz
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
create a pull request to introduce your changes. other teams can review your changes
go to pull requests and select compare to with your branch and add a comment and create a pull request in github

once you create a pull request if you have any reviews respond to that review
check out to your current branch
git checkout my-slide //if you have moved between branches earlier make sure again checkout your current branch
git status// confirm the branch and any other staged files are there or not using this command
git pull// pull the latest files from vcs
modify the required files and then add to staging
git add _posts/soandsofile.xyz // now the file is in staging alternatively use git add .
git commit -m "with new message"

Merge the pull request
git chekout main //checkout the main branch
git pull //get latest changes if any in main branch
git merge my-slide //merge the branch you want to merge
git push //push the merge request
git branch -d my-slide //delete the branch from locally
//also delete the branch from github ui from server
